ASL ~2023.8 %hw6 %delta

It's a rather simple agent with push and pop actions applied to
the state which is a stack of values.

This README isn't markdown because delta already has a txt mark
thus it can can be committed to Urbit as well.

There are tests and generators in gen/delta for easier dojo use.

Included is the extra delta-follower agent, though not booted. 

Starter doc.toc that points to doc/ though yet unclear how Docs
would pick them up to show alongside other doc included by default.
